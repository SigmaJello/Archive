## ❌ Common Errors & Fixes

#### # 1 - "Sigma5" doesn't show up in the launcher / shows up as an "error version"

This means that you're using TLauncher. **Sigma5 doesn't work with TLauncher** & The Launcher itself is terrible with accusations of being a spyware. Please use the official Minecraft Launcher or use SKLauncher from here if you need cracked / offline account support. (Sigma5 works with SKLauncher)

#### # 2 - The Main Menu is extremely laggy

**There is currently no fix for this issue**, as the only "fix" would be to disconnect your internet, but that isn't an option since you'd probably want to play on multiplayer servers. For the time being, just spam the button that you want (for example, Singleplayer, Multiplayer, or the Alt Manager) till it opens.

#### # 3 - I can't register to the client!

Sigma was shut down a LONG time ago, so obviously, creating accounts won't work.
‍
#### # 4 - The client is stuck at (insert percentage).

Disconnect your internet and then launch the client. Once it launched, you can reconnect your internet.

#### # 5 - The ClickGUI doesn't open when i press RSHIFT

It's not bound by default. To fix this, join a world, then press ESC on your keyboard. Then, click "Jello for Sigma Options" and then press on "Keybind Manager". Now, bind the "ClickGUI" module to any key of your choice (preferrably Right Shift)
